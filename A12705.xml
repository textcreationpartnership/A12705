            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>TO THE RIGHT HONO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RABLE, ARTHVR LORD GREY OF WILTON, KNIGHT OF THE NOBLE</hi> order of the Garter, his very good Lord and Patrone: Thomas Sparke wiſheth the encreaſe of all good ſpirituall graces, with health, wealth, and true honors to Gods glorie, and his owne full contentation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince the preaching of this fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſermon following (right Honorable) I haue beene ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly vrged, &amp; entreated both by wordes and letters of good brethren to commit the ſame to writing, and ſo to the print. And in deede their dealing with mee therein hath beene ſo effectuall, that, though I had rather preach ten ſermons, than pen one, and haue alwaies hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto beene very hard, conſidering the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of bookes already publiſhed, to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to publiſh any of my poore labors, yet in this, loe, I am ouercommed. And truely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt diuers other reaſons moouing mee to yeeld hereunto, this hath not been one of the wekeſt, that therby not only they which heard mee preach it might for that preſent haue ſo noble an example both of ſincere religion, and holy life ſounded in their eares, but alſo both
<pb facs="tcp:15250:3"/>they and others at their pleaſure might haue the ſame laide downe before their eies, to the ſtirring vp and prouoking them, the rather by conſideration of the doctrine ſet downe in this ſermon, to imitate and followe the ſame. For ſeeing it hath pleaſed our God (no doubt of great mercy to him) thus, as hee hath, to take him in peace from vs, that wee cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer enioy him liuing amongſt vs as hee hath done, yet by this and ſuch like meanes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſort (I hope) to the good of many he ſhall liue ſtill. Nay I am out of doubt of it, that as his death was precious in the eies of the Lorde, ſo he ſhalbe had in euerlaſting remembrance, &amp; his name ſhall neuer be put out. In the meane time it is greatly to be wiſhed, that we, whome he hath left behinde, would take occaſion by this his taking from vs, to learne that, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen therby wee haue iuſt occaſion giuen vs by the Lorde to learne, which is; to feare that the Lord is in preparing ſome great ſcourge for vs for our great vnthankfulnes after ſo many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites both heauenly and earthly a long time beſtowed vppon vs, in that hee beginneth thus to gleane from vs (leaſt they ſhould ſee to their griefe the euils to come) ſuch deare ſeruants of his: and thereby alſo to take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to repent, and to turne vnto the Lord vnfeynedly, that ſo he may turne the deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb facs="tcp:15250:3"/>euill day from vs. For in the 2, of <hi>Eſay.</hi> 3. for the like ſinnes and tranſgreſſions of the people, as are amongſt vs, the Lorde threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that euen therefore <hi>hee would take away the honourable and vviſe counſeller.</hi> And yet notwithſtanding this plaine vvarning after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the Prophet complayneth thus. <hi>The righteous periſhe, and no man conſidereth it in his heart: and mercifull men are taken avvate, and no man vnderſtandeth that the righteous is taken avvaie from the euill to come, Chap.</hi> 57.1. And I feare though the Lorde hath not barely threatned, but in deede hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from vs an Honourable and vviſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller, in that this worthy Earle of Bedforde is nowe deade and buried, that yet moſt iuſtly the Prophets complainte maie bee renued amongeſt vs. God of his mercy therefore giue vs grace better to conſider thereof e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one of vs, that vvee maie finde out the Lordes counſell therein: and ſo take occaſion, by an effectuall and vniuerſall turning vnto the Lorde to preuent the euill thereby, and by ſuch other like examples threatned to come vppon vs. It maie bee that the enuious and malitious Papiſt (who alwaies gathereth poyſon thence, from whence hee ſhoulde and might, if hee had the grace, gather honie) vvill not ſticke to
<pb facs="tcp:15250:4"/>thinke and ſay alſo, that God hath taken him away, as he hath, &amp; his three ſonnes with him in his anger and diſpleaſure towardes him and his houſe. But whoſoeuer conſidereth the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſet downe in this ſermon, they all liuing &amp; dying in the Lord, and in her maieſties loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and faithfull obedience, as they did, hee ſhall bee enforced to confeſſe, that (by what meanes, or by what kinde of ſickneſſe ſo euer they parted hence) they died in the fauour of God: &amp; who ſo weigheth further, that it is the Lords property to beginne euen at his owne houſe, thereby to woorke a greater terrour in others, and withall foreſeeth vvhat heauie plagues and miſerable daies our ſinnes dayly cry and call for, he cannot chuſe but ſee, that the Lorde herein hath ſhewed a marueilous great mercy to him, and to thoſe of his houſe. Truely by occaſion hereof rather (to the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of al papiſts, who obey not the goſpell of God) we may ſay with <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>Epi.</hi> 4.17. The time is come that iudgement muſt beginne at the houſe of God. If it firſt beginne at vs, what ſhall the ende bee of them, that obey not the goſpel of god? But (to leaue this noble Earle &amp; his ſonnes in the hands of the Lord in bleſſed teſt &amp; peace, and theſe malitious papiſts to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues as men in whome then ſinne of ſpirituall whooredome with the gariſh &amp; Babylonicall
<pb facs="tcp:15250:4"/>harlot is growen to ſuch rottenneſſe in their bones, that there is ſmall hope, or rather none at all of their recouery, ſuch is the iudgement of God vpon them, becauſe light is come into the worlde, and yet they loue darknes more than light) concerning this ſermon following (right Honourable) it may be in peruſing of it you will finde ſome difference in it, from that which you heard. In wordes it cannot bee but there is, becauſe I had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but ſhort notes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and it is impoſſible for me to call to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the very wordes, wherein I vttered it. But as for matter I am ſure you will perceiue it is all one with the other, and in wordes too, as neare as memorie could well ſerue to call them to minde. In deede becauſe then when I preached it in diuers points I was enforced (as I thinke you might well perceiue) through the ſhortnes of time left and alotted me, but ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily to touch many thinges, that more at large I had purpoſed to haue proſecuted, and therefore perhaps then was the obſcurer; I haue heare in this according to my ful purpoſe and premeditation then ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it groweth to bee ſomewhat longer nowe, than it was then. The hardnes and vnpleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the ſtile I muſt deſire your Honour, and all others to beare withall. For (as you knowe) my manner is not at anie time to ſtudie for
<pb facs="tcp:15250:5"/>wordes, but for matter. Which ſo I deliuer in ſuch wordes as I may bee vnderſtood of them that heare mee, I care for no more. For the thing onely that I alwaies ſeeke, is to edifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that heare me with as good and neceſſary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as I can. As for gloriouſneſſe of words &amp; pleaſant and delicate ſpeech I think it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the philoſophers chaire, but not the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit. For I finde, that <hi>Paul</hi> hath written, that <hi>hee vvas not ſent to Preache the Goſpell vvith vviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of vvoordes, leaſt the Croſſe of Chriſt ſhould bee made of none effect,</hi> 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.17. And therefore <hi>vvhen hee came among them</hi> he ſaieth <hi>hee came not vvith excellencie of vvoordes, or of vviſedome, ſhevving vnto them the teſtimonie of God. For hee eſteemed not to knovve anie thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, ſaue onelie Ieſus Chriſt and him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,</hi> 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2.1.2. Sometimes there are ſome ſentences of the Doctors and ancient fathers interlaced, but they are not by mee at any time alleadged as though their teſtimonie or iudgement vvere a ſufficient argument to grounde a trueth vpon. For all trueth muſt haue and hath his ſufficient warrant from the canonicall Scriptures; and hauing ſo, it is a trueth though all the Doctors and Fathers ſhoulde gaine-ſaie it. I onely therefore bring them in as vvitneſſes of the trueth in their times receiued, partly to ſhewe the Popiſh
<pb facs="tcp:15250:5"/>vaine bragge of antiquitie in theſe pointes, and partely to beate them from their errours vvith their owne weapons. Howbeit here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I haue beene very ſparing, though indeed I might haue beene in the citing of them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie plentifull, they are ſo full of excellent ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to the ſame endes and purpoſes, for the vvhich theſe fewe out of them vvere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged. Nowe my reaſons that moue me to bee ſo bolde, as to make this Sermon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare againe after this ſorte vnder your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippes protection, making my choiſe of you to dedicate it vnto, are theſe: Firſt I am perſwaded that you vvere a principall meanes, that I vvas occaſioned firſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue and preach it. Secondly, you are the man, to whome among all other and aboue all other I am moſt bound for your manifolde kindeneſſes diuerſly ſhewed vnto mee: and therefore hee that maie moſt iuſtly chalenge all dutifulneſſe, and tokens of thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, vvhich lie in my poore povver to ſhewe: amongeſt vvhich I beſeech you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this as one, though it bee but a ſmall one. Thirdely I knowe ſuche is your ſincere affection to the trueth of Doctrine therein contayned, and ſuch vvas your vnfayned loue and affection to-vvardes
<pb facs="tcp:15250:6"/>him, whoſe memoriall it ſtill reuiueth: that as you took pleaſure in hearing of it once, ſo you wil delight your ſelfe in reading &amp; peruſing of it often. Which reaſons conſidered I hope you will beare with my boldnes herein, and others I truſt, whoſoeuer they bee, will approue of this my ſo doing. And therefore beſeeching the Lord of his mercy long to preſerue you, &amp; your vertuous and good wife my verie good Ladie with all your children in health, all true honour and proſperity, I ceaſe from any farther troubling of your Honor at this time. At Bletchley the 25. of December, 1585.</p>

And the more reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently both to mooue me to ſpeake thereof, and to prouoke you all the more attentiuely to liſten to that which is therin auouched, we are to wey y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that which herein is ſet down is a propoſition or aſſertion not firſt deuiſed, vttered, and recorded by the will &amp; wit of man, but which came downe from heauen, left in writing thus vnto vs by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and ſpeciall commandement from thence, confirmed alſo to be moſt true by the aſſent and approbation of the holy Ghoſt. For <hi>Iohn</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued diſciple of Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; a faithfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe teſtifieth vnto vs, that he heard a voice from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:15250:7"/>heauen commaunding him to write it, &amp; alſo hee telleth vs, that this heauenly voice had no ſooner tolde him, that the thing which he ſhoulde write was this, Bleſſed are they that dye in the Lorde thenceforth, but that the Spirit ſaid yea vnto it, adding further, that ſuch reſt from their labors, and that the woorkes of ſuch accompany them. Wherefore in the feare of God, we are al of vs ſo to conſider of the matter taught vs in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, as of matter moſt weighty, moſt certain &amp; true. For if <hi>Iohn</hi> himſelf had left it in writing but by the ordinarye direction of his Apoſtolike ſpirite, wee ought not at all to haue doubted, either of the neceſſarineſſe, or certainety thereof. For euen thereby both hee and all the reſt of his fellowes, writers of the Canonical Scriptures, were euer preſerued in their writinges both from all erring in their writings, and alſo from committing vnto writing any needeleſſe or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profit able thing. Howe much leſſe, it being (as you haue hearde) moſt earneſtlie affirmed, and by moſt inuincible authoritie confirmed and ſtrengthened, may we doubt of any thing taught vs in this heauenly oracle: Out of all doubt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen hereby we are (to begin with al) al of vs faſt bound, moſt readily to beleeue euery thing to be moſt certainelye true, which herein is taught, whatſoeuer wee haue taught heeretofore, or fleſhe and bloode can ſay to the contrarie hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15250:11"/>the tyranny of Antichriſt ſhall looſe their liues for the profeſſion of the pure doctrine of Chriſt. That it is ſpoken to the comforte of ſuch, yea and eſpecially to the comforte of ſuch, I will eaſilie graunt: but onely to the comfort of ſuch, and therefore onely of ſuch, I cannot in anie caſe think. For (no doubt of it) the Lord hauing fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewed vnto <hi>Iohn.</hi> the fall of Antichriſtes king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the maner how, and conſequently ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing let him in ſpirite foreſee, howe he woulde free and chafe againſt all thoſe, that beeing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed by the Goſpell ſhoulde fully ſeperate themſelues from him, to reſt onely in and vpon Chriſt: as he did thereupon foreſee, that he would raiſe cruell perſecution againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that through the feare thereof he mihgt reclaime them; ſo hee (without all peraduenture) in ſpirite foreſawe, that no faire meanes, or ſubtile perſwaſions would be omitted, to heale vp the wound of the beaſt again withal: &amp; that the ſaints of god ſhould finde is as hard a matter to ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſtedfaſt in Chriſt vnto their liues end againſt thoſe aſſaultes, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other, that is his cruell perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For daily experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce teacheth, that this way he preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth more a great deale, than by the other. And therefore if there were cauſe why theſe words of my text ſhould be vttered &amp; recorded to animate &amp; incourage men in the time of perſecution to ſtand ſtedfaſt in the truth againſt Antichriſt, there was
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15250:11"/>as good cauſe, why they ſhoulde bee ſo alſo to the ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthning of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to liue &amp; die in the ſame truth, what faire allurements, ſubtil deuiſes, or cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſoeuer were vſed to draw them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame.

And yet though they haue it gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted them that the words eſpecially concerne Martyrs, yet vnderſtanding the words generally, they ſerue aſwel to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of them, &amp; rather better, than if they were true only in them. For this argument followeth ſtrongly, whoſoeuer dieth in the Lord, that is in a right &amp; ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d chriſtian faith, he is thenceforth im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mediatly bleſſed, &amp; therfore martyrs, who not on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly dye in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith, but for that faith. Further, who knoweth not, that it is an vſuall thing in the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, &amp; in all other good learning, to proue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars by generals? And therfore what reaſon is there to the contrary, but that here to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting of them that dye for the Lord, the bleſſed ſtate generally of al that dye in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, ſhould be ſet foorth, wherein they might ſee themſelues of al other vndoubtedly included? Hereby then it appeareth, that their reaſon of reſtraining the words to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only that dye for the Lord, is taken away, &amp; therfore alſo the conſequent, which they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:15250:12"/>wold infer therupon falleth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground. Beſides this, diuerſe reaſons I haue, which inforce me to vnderſtand the woordes generally of all that die in the Lord, when and whereſoeuer, and they are theſe, firſt it is ſomewhat harde to tranſlate <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which is, in the Lorde, for the Lorde. Secondly, when the circumſtance &amp; coherence of the text wil wel ſuffer (as in this place) that it ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a ſenſe to the generall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of Gods Church then vnneceſſarily to reſtraine it to ſome ſort of members therof only, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be but a fault. For it is, as it were a needleſſe ſhrinking vp of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news, and pulling in of the armes of the holy ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. And laſtly in the interpreting of ſcripture it is a rule greatly to be commended, If the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of the ſenſe ariſe vpon a phraſe of ſpeech (as here it doth) to conſider the vſe of the ſame or like phraſe in other places of ſcripture, and to take it in that ſenſe, that beſt agreeth with the vſe ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of in other places of ſcripture, Now in this caſe we neither finde, that to liue in the Lord, or to die in the Lorde are taken in any other place for to liue or die for the Lordes ſake: but to dye in the Lorde to bee taken in this generall ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For it were to reſtrain the comfort of the generall reſurrection only to ſuch. Theſe and ſome other ſuch like reaſons (as it ſhould ſeeme) haue inforced our Rhemiſts vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this place (though they plainly ſhew, that they would very gladly haue the words reſtrained on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Martyrs, that ſo eaſily they might ſhifte off the place when it is alleadged againſt their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory) to confeſſe that yet it may be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken generally of all that departe in the ſtate of grace. Wherefore ſeeing this general ſenſe moſt fully and ſtrongly anſwereth the circumſtances of the text, beſt agreeth with the letter therof, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth more generall comfort to Gods children, accordeth beſt with the vſe of the ſame, and other the like phraſes in other places of the Scripture (in ſo much that our very aduerſaries, againſt whom moſt that ſenſr maketh, haue in print con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that, that may be the ſenſe) we may ſafelye conclude, that they which are here ſpoken of, are all generally, that depart this life in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus our Lorde, whether they liued or dyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt, or ſince, or ſhall hereafter; and children dying within Gods election and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt.<note place="margin">The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note>

It is not enough therefore for ſuch to knowe the Lorde, what hee is in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and what hee is in office, and to be able and willing to vtter their knowledge, vnleſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall they proceede euen to be in the Lord.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode bee vnited; ſo that thereupon it muſt needs thus ſtand with vs, that vntill wee bee in Chriſt, and ſo one with him, wee remaine ſtill deade in our ſinnes and treſpaſſes, at enmitye with God, and indeede without life before him. But when it is once come to paſſe, that wee are in him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted and growing in him, then our heauenly father, being well pleaſed in him, becommeth to be ſo alſo in vs for his ſake. Whereuppon it muſt needes bee, that our ſinnes are forgiuen, and that we are at one againe with God, and liue in deede in his ſight, in that Chriſt liueth in vs and wee in him. So that as neceſſary as the vnion of the ſoule and body of man be to cauſe this temporall life: ſo needefull is the vnion of Chriſt ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to euery man to cauſe him to liue before God. For as the body is dead when the ſoul is ſundred from it; ſo whole man, though otherwiſe in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of this common life he be neuer ſo liuely, is ſtarke dead ſpiritually, whiles Chriſt and hee be

For if it be thus they ſhall liue for euer by him, otherwiſe they remain in death, wither, and muſt periſh.

And this is the thing that nowe next wee haue to Conſider of. Concerning which we are to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that on Gods part offering this bleſſed vnion and fellowſhippe vnto vs, his outwarde meanes is the whole miniſterie of his worde and Sacraments. For we reade, <hi>Epheſ. <hi>4.</hi>
               </hi> that <hi>hee hath appointed</hi> it namely to this end, <hi>to gather together his Saints, for the edification of the

               </hi> plainely confeſſeth, that <hi>the ende of his miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and his fellowes the Apoſtles was this, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. That which we haue hearde and ſeene, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare wee vnto you, that yee may alſo haue fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhippe with vs, and that our fellowſhip alſo may bee with the father, and with the ſonne Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> By the worde preached generally the doctrine of this vnion is laide open to our eares: in the adminiſtration of the ſacraments it is alſo, the better to make vs to embrace it, not onely ſet before our eies, but confirmed, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly offered, and ratifyed vnto vs. Gods inwarde meanes, whereby hee maketh this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde effectuall vnto vs, is the effectuall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his ſpirite in our heartes. For it <hi>was hee that opened Lydias heart to attende vnto the thinges that Paul ſpake to her ſaluation, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.14.15. And Paul may plant and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo water, but it is GOD, that muſt giue
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:15250:16"/>the encreaſe,</hi> or elſe the other will be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.7.</hi> Now the meanes on our part, whereby by the foreſaide meanes we are enabled to take &amp; apprehend this vnion offered, is a ſound and a right faith in Chriſt Ieſus. I ſay ſound, becauſe it muſt be vnfeined: and right, becauſe it muſt not bee erronious, nor hereticall: in Chriſt Ieſus, becauſe to the apprehenſion of this fellowſhippe with Chriſt, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all the mercies of GOD layd vp for vs in him, it is not enough to beleeue either that he is, or what he is, vnleſſe we beleeue alſo rightly in him being ſuch a one. But in this I ſpeake but of them of ſufficient age and deſcretion. For, as for children borne in the Church, dying in their infancie, and others borne and dying idiots in the ſame, borne of ſuch parents, as the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>(Gen. <hi>17. I will bee thy GOD, and the GOD of thy ſeede after thee)</hi>
               </hi> belongeth unto, no doubt of it the Lorde can and doeth by the force of this election and other extraordinarie meanes vnite vnto his ſonne. And therefore we are to hope, that ſuch die in the Lorde. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand therefore, that I heerein haue ſpoken, and in that, which followeth, meane to ſpeake on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thoſe, to whome the Lorde giueth yeares and diſcretion, ſo that if the fault bee not in themſelues, they are capable of the doctrine of faith.</p>

               <note place="margin">That by faith this vnion is attained.</note>Nowe to proue, that faith hath this office ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed vnto it of God, to apprehend Chriſt, &amp; to make him our owne by the former meanes offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs, the ſcripture is moſt cleare and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:15250:17"/>alſo is euident, in that you ſhall find in that chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter within the compaſſe of the foreſaide verſes, the ſame thinges both promiſed to the eaters and drinkers of Chriſtes fleſhe and bloude, and to the beleeuers in him, and alſo the ſame things threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the not eaters and drinkers thereof, which are to the not beleeuers in him.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:15250:18"/>by faith.</hi>
               </hi> So that by all theſe proofes laide together wee ſee that Chriſt is receiued by faith, that wee growe in him by faith, yea to a perfect man in Gods ſight, and laſtly that hee is as ſurely apprehended of vs by faith to our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall maintenance in the worde preached, and ſacramentes miniſtred (which are the diſhes wherein one and the ſelfe-ſame Chriſt is offered vnto vs) as meate and drinke being ſet before vs is taken in by eating or drinking thereof to our temporall nouriſhment, Whereof the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſtes body and bloud is a moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall ratification, and particular confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to euery right receiuer thereof by faith. If it were otherwiſe that wee coulde not get to be in Chriſt, and hee in vs by faith in him, but to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhe this it were neceſſary bodily to take him into vs by the mouth of our bodies, then (foraſmuch as there were neuer any that died that coulde be bleſſed, that died not in him) all the good Patriarkes, Prophets, and other ſeruantes of GOD that died before hee had an humane body, muſt bee condemned. But the contrary thereof is euident, in that <hi>Abraham is placed in ſtate of ſaluation by Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.24. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea and with Abraham; Iſaac, and Iacob, in the kingdome of heauen, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.28.29.</hi> And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> is bolde <hi>1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3.4.</hi> to ſay of them that were before Chriſt, that <hi>they all

Let a houſe ſtande but halflings vppon the foundation, it cannot ſtande: it will fall: ſo in this caſe they that would ſurely ſtand before the Lord, they muſt fully bee ſetled, and reſt vppon the onely foundation Chriſt. Whereuppon it muſt néeds follow, that the popiſh Church is not Gods ſpiritual houſe, becauſe neither the whole houſe generally, nor any member thereof parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, taketh it ſelfe onely to ſtande, and to bee vpholden vppon, and by Chriſt alone. For it is currant doctrine with them yet, that Chriſt by his ſufferinges hath not ſo ſatiſfied the iuſtice of his heauenly father, as that hee will not require further ſatisfaction at the hands of him, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:15250:23"/>in him. For they plainely teach, that though to ſuch, their ſinnes be forgiuen, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the penalty due therefore, this is onely done, that by the merites of Chriſt, whereas it ſhould be euerlaſting miſerie, nowe for his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites God will be content to accept of a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary ſatisfaction; and ſo partly for that and partly for his ſonnes ſatisfaction hee will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite them. And here it is worthy to be noted, that the Lord hath ſo ſtroken that generation in his iuſt iudgement with blockiſh ſottiſhnes, for this their robbing of his deare ſon of his glorie which is due vnto him, that whereas in this their doctrine they ioyne other meanes &amp; helpes, to deliuer men from their ſinnes, to the ſalue, and plaiſter which Chriſt hath made, as though his were either not broade enough to couer the ſore, or not good enough to cure it, the meanes that they deuiſe are ſo childiſhe and ſo vnfit to be mingled with the precious bloude of Chriſt, as that they make themſelues ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, in attributing deliuerance from ſinne vnto them. As for example, they attribute the power to deliuer from ſinne to their holie water, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oyle, holy ſalt, holy creame, holy breade, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly palmes, holy croſſe; yea and to what toye ſoeuer, if it be but a graine, or a beade hollowed of the Pope; as their ſeruice bookes, which yet they vſe, and too too groſſe experience, haue
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:15250:24"/>taught vs. Sinne is ſo ſmall a matter with them, that ſome ſinnes muſt needes of their own nature be veniall, and therefore our learned Rhemiſtes in their notes vppon the <hi>10.</hi> of <hi>Mat.</hi> hold that a Biſhoppes bleſſing will wipe them out; going on pilgrimage, offering of Candels to ſtocks &amp; ſtones, and ſuch like deedes of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inioyned by a Ghoſtly Father in waie of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce; yea ſaying of fiue Aue Maries, three Pater noſters, and three Creedes are counted of them good meanes of ſatisfactions to deliuer the beleeuer from that which the pretious &amp; bloudy ſatisfaction of Chriſt hath not deliuered him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And which is of al the reſt moſt abſurd, a number of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as it is too wel known by their atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pts, &amp; practiſes both in Englande and elſe where), are growen to bee of this opinion, that traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſlie and treacherouſlie to murther their naturall Prince, for that hee or ſhee fauoreth not the Popiſhe faith, is become nowe a meanes to merite and to obtayne plenarie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of all ſinne, to the partie that will hazarde his life to doe it, and yet this they wil not graunt that the beleeuer in Ieſus Chriſt canne haue, by Chriſtes dying a moſt bitter death.</p>
            <p>O horrible blaſphemie, and yet their day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie practiſe putteth vs out of doubt, that this is their opinion, and their couering and ſhrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15250:24"/>their manifold treaſons vnder the pretence of their religion co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmeth the ſame. And wheras to ſaluation two thinges are neceſſarie, firſt quite to bee deliuered from ſinne and from the daunger thereof, which otherwiſe woulde ſinke vs downe to hell: and then a perfect righteouſneſſe, that can not but bee ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted in the righteous and iuſt iudgement of God. Whereby a right claime and title may bee had to heauen, and both theſe are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prouided and prepared for all right belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, in the Meſſias, as after you ſhall heare. As they will not ſeeke for the former in his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions alone, but partly alſo in their own: ſo concerning the latter, they euen with the blind and phariſaicall Iewes <hi>Rom. <hi>10.3.</hi>
               </hi> are ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the righteouſneſſe whirh God in Chriſt hath prepared to make men righteous by, that they ſeeke to that end ſtill to eſtabliſh their owne righteouſneſſe. For at no hand they can abide, that men ſhould beleeue that the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt ſhould be imputed vnto the beleeuer in Chriſt for righteouſneſſe. This they count ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurde, and therefore in their <hi>Tridentine</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenticle accurſe it as an hereſie. In the meane time holding, that the workes which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues doe after faith, is the formall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whereby they deſerue to bee accompted righteous before God. In which point (becauſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:15250:25"/>their owne conſciences tell them, that their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth greatly to the derogatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſts glorie) to coulour the Antichriſtianity thereof as well yet as may bee, they haue now found out this deuiſe to ſay, that their owne works are not ſo of their owne worthineſſe, &amp; abſoluteneſſe, but through the worthineſſe of the merites of Chriſt. Which in effect, in plainer tearms is to ſay, that Chriſt came not perfectly to ſaue by himſelfe, &amp; to be a full ſauiour in his own perſon, but to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite: that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might by their own works be their own ſauiours: as though Chriſt died to be our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior, to poſt ouer either part, or the whole of that his office to any thing wrought by man. And as their doctrine is, ſo is their faith. For to take it at the beſt (as now they haue fined it) thereby they ſeek in Chriſt but their former iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which they accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t nothing els, but the firſt tranſlation from the ſtate of mere naturall men, to the ſtate of grace &amp; fauor of God. And yet eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> herunto they hold, that men may haue workes of preparation of their owne common abilitie, left vnto them of nature: but as for ſinnes done after this former iuſtification attained, they beleeue they muſt flie to a ſecond refuge, which they call the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Penance, for them: and ſo they beleeue they muſt either in this life by them-ſelues, or after in Purgatorie, ſatisfie for theſe ſinnes, partly by their owne ſufferinges, and partly by
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:15250:25"/>deedes done for them by others, after they bee dead. And for the ſeconde iuſtification, which is the conſummation and perfection of the former, they beleeue that that muſt bee made vppe, and finiſhed by their owne merites, made<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> able to merice their ſaluation by the merites of Chriſt. And that this is their faith and their docerine euen nowe, I coulde make it euident from point to point out of the <hi>Tridentine</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, the Cenſurer of Coled, <hi>Caniſius</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme, the Romiſh Catechiſme, and our of our own coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

A doctrine of doubtfulneſſe: Yea they count that their doubtfulnes, humility: &amp; the aſſurance, that true faith breedeth, preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. Euen the bare opening vnto you thus, what the popiſh faith is (I hope) ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vnto you, that they that die in ſuch a faith, cannot bee ſaide to die in the Lorde Ieſus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that out of the Lorde Ieſus (you ſee) in themſelues and others, they ſeeke a great part of their ſaluation. Howbeit, becauſe it is a point of great importance and weight, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as yet great multitudes will not bee ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily reſolued, let vs ſee howe from point to point this their faith and religion is oppoſite and contrarye to Gods reuealed will in his worde.<note place="margin">The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed firſt generally.</note>
            </p>
            <p>They holde (as you haue heard) generally this, that Chriſt in his own perſon, by that which he hath doone himſelfe, hath not already done,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:15250:26"/>whatſoeuer is neceſſary for man to be iuſtifled &amp; ſaued by. And therefore they ad thereunto their own ſatisfactions &amp; merits, by his doings &amp; this togither, to make vp their iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ſaluation. But the ſcripture ſaith. <hi>Heb. <hi>7.25. he is able per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to ſaue thoſe, that come vnto God by him: <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. by the will of God we are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the offering of the body of Ieſus Chriſt once made;</hi>
               </hi> &amp; a litle after verſe <hi>14. with one offering hath he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated for euer them that are ſanctified.</hi> And Chriſt himſelfe that knew beſt to giue an infallible note of his owne body the Church, telleth vs <hi>Matth. <hi>22.1.</hi>
               </hi> that the ſounde and earhand of the true Meſſengers therein is this. <hi>All things are already prepared (namely in the mariage of the kings ſon) come vnto the mariage.</hi> Whereby it is moſt cleare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the word ſetteth forth Chriſt vnto vs as one that of himſelfe, &amp; by himſelfe hath already done what ſoeuer we are to looke to be ſaued by or for.<note place="margin">Then par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in three points.</note> To leaue now the generall ground of their faith, and to come to the particulars thereof, firſt you heare that they hold, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that Chriſt hath not clean purged by himſelfe, and by that which he hath done in his own perſon, thoſe that beleue in him, both fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ſinnes, &amp; from the penalty due for the ſame; and that therefore, God requireth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſatisfying of his iuſtice, fully ſome further ſatisfaction at their own handes. But we reane to the contrarie
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:15250:27"/>in the Scriptures. For there it is thus written. <hi>The bloud of the ſon of God doth clenſe vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all ſinne, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.7.</hi> and leaſt this ſhould be taken as ſpoken onely of ſinnes before faith, <hi>Iohn</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and putteth himſelfe in the number, and yet long before that be had faith; <hi>If we ſay, we haue no ſin, we deceiue our ſelues, &amp; the truth is not in vs: If we acknowledge our ſinnes he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; iuſt, to forgiue vs our ſinnes, &amp; to clenſe vs from all vnrighteouſnes.</hi> If they reply, that all this proueth but <hi>remiſſionem omnis culpae,</hi> that is forgiueneſſe of the fault or guilt onely, of all our ſinnes, and not alſo of the puniſhment, I pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceede and aske them, whether the curſe of the lawe and damnation bee not puniſhmentes due for ſinne, and then whether theſe be not the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, and include not the reſt. They cannot deny, but theſe are puniſhments due for ſinne, &amp; that the greateſt alſo including all other. If therefore the Scripture teach vs, that Chriſt hath freed vs from theſe, then it is euident, that he hath freed vs from all. Wherefore marke that it is thus written, <hi>Rom. <hi>8.1. There is no condemnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to thoſe that are in Chriſt:</hi>
               </hi> &amp; <hi>Gal, <hi>3.13. Chriſt hath redeemed vs from the curſe of the law, when he was made a curſe for vs.</hi>
               </hi> If it were not thus, that they that beleeue in Chriſt were aſſured, that Chriſt had freed them both from all their ſinnes, and alſo from their penalty
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:15250:27"/>due therefore, how coulde it be true that we read: <hi>Rom. <hi>5.1.2. that they that are iuſtified by faith haue peace with God through Chriſt,</hi>
               </hi> &amp; acceſſe <hi>to his grace, wherin they ſtand &amp; re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I will forgiue their iniquitie, and remember their ſinnes no more?</hi>
               </hi> Yea how can it ſtand with Gods iuſtice, that hauing for-giuen to the beleeuer all his ſinnes, hee yet ſhould puniſh him for them, and cauſe him to ſatisfie for them: Will God puniſh and driue to ſatisfaction, where the cauſe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken away? &amp; when he hath been ſatisfied at once already to the vttermoſt farthing, as it is euident he hath beene in Chryſt for al that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in him? For other wyſe Chriſt hauing taken vpon him to ſatisfie the iuſtice of his heauenlye Father ſhoulde not, nor coulde not haue riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, aſcended into heauen, and ſit at the right hand of his father. Thereby it is euident, that by his abaſement, he hath fully ſatisfied his father &amp; gone through with the work he took in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; is now able to apply y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame to thoſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> be his. Yea but all this letteth not (wil they ſay) but that we may hold ſtill, that by our ſatisfactions God in part is ſatisfied, ſeeing we graunt that they are
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:15250:28"/>made auailable ſatisfactions by Chriſtes ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Yea but that were yet to ſay, that Chriſt purgeth his from their ſinnes not by himſelf, but by the helpe and ſufferings of others: the plaine contrary whereof wee reade, <hi>Heb. <hi>1.3.</hi>
               </hi> in theſe words, <hi>He hath by himſelf, purged our ſinnes.</hi> How ſay you then to manyfold afflictions, and in the ende to death, laid vppon them, that beleeue, ſay they? I anſweare, that theſe are no ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions to God for ſinnes already commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but they are his fatherly chaſtiſements, to admoniſh vs to repent vs of ſinnes paſte, and to take heed of ſinne hereafter. And they are both occaſions to them to exerciſe their vertues, and to thoſe that are without inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to take heed of going on in wickednes, ſeeing the Lord ſo chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his owne houſe. And as for death, the ſtinge thereof is taken away in reſpect of ſuch; ſoy how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it be &amp; remain the rewarde of ſin to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuer, yet to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beleeue, it is but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt ſtrok of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> battel, &amp; as the dore thorow which they paſſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this worlde full of miſery to the next full of ioy and felicity. It is a pitifull thing, that of theſe they cannot tell what to make, vnleſſe they make them meanes to derogate from the moſt ſufficient and infinite ſatisfaction made by Chriſt. If the glory of Chriſt were deare vnto them, as it ought, &amp; they were perſwaded, as they ſhould, that he was both able &amp; willing to go tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:15250:28"/>with the worke which he tooke in hand; that is, to be a perfect and a ful Sauiour in himſelfe, and by himſelfe, whatſoeuer they thought of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they would not once dare to cauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to encroch thus vpon his office. Alas it is lighter then vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie it ſelfe for them to ſay, that by the vertue of Chriſt there is deſerued for them that beleeue in him, that eternall puniſhments due to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhould be turned into te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall, &amp; y for his ſake God will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent himſelf with theſe. For firſt it is a mere de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiſe of their owne head, vtterly without warrant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods reuealed wil in his word: ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly howe can it ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with any reaſon, that he y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> for Chriſts ſake wil forgiue the greater, wil ſtick at the leſſe, that he that will forgiue the eternal puniſhment, wil not for-giue the temporary: And laſtly what a toy is it to imagine, that Chriſt tooke ſo much paines to ſatisfie the iuſtice of his heauenlye fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to leaue the accompliſhment thereof to the vncertainty of mens ſatisfactions?</p>
            <p>

That ſaying of Chriſt to his <hi>(Luke. <hi>17.10.</hi>)</hi> is directly contrary to their poſition, where hee ſayth, <hi>when ye haue doone all thoſe thinges that are commanded you, ſay wee are vnprofitable ſeruantes: wee haue doone that which was our duetie to doe.</hi> For heereby not in way of curteſie (as ſome of them haue ſayde.) but in ſadneſſe we are taught, that if wee kept the whole lawe in euery pointe, which neuer man did, but Chriſt, that yet we are to account our ſelues ſo farre from hauing meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any thing thereby at Gods handes, that we are to thinke, we haue but payde him that which we ought him: and therefore merited no more at his handes, than an olde ill better may ſay he hath merited at his creditours handes, when he payeth him but his hare owne, How much more

               </hi> where hee affirmeth that that righteouſneſſe, which is called <hi>the righteouſneſſe of GOD, is reuealed by the Goſpell from faith to faith.

And ſo though the papiſtes in woordes confeſſe Chriſt to be come in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh, yet becauſe indeede
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:15250:39"/>&amp; truth they will not let him be prieſt alone, to offer propitiatory ſacrifice: king alone, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne by his owne orders: prophet alone, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct by his owne woorde: but (as it is moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident) ioyne vnto him a ſucceſſion of prieſtes to iterate his ſacrifice, <hi>which he offered once for all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.25.26.</hi> alter his lawes and orders, ad and detract at their pleaſure too and from his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed and written woorde, as the face and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of their Church teacheth, indeede and truth they deny that he is come in the fleſh. And it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the prophecies that wee haue in the ſcripture of Antichriſt, that hee ſhall not bee ſo blunt a foole: as flatly and in playne tearmes to denye ſo manifeſt an article of fayth, as this is, but hee and his ſhall come and ſet abroach their falſe doctrin <hi>through hypocriſie. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2.</hi> In ſo much that antichriſtianitye <hi>2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.7.</hi> is called <hi>a miſtery of iniquitie,</hi> that is an iniquity that not all at once and openly ſhall ſhew is ſelfe, but that ſhall come in by ſoft and ſtealing paſes ſo ſhrowded and hid vnder a ſhew of godlineſſe. that it ſhould not eaſily be eſpyed.

               </hi> that the Babyloniſh harlotte is deſcribed to <hi>hold out vnto others her abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and filthy fornications in a golden cuppe:</hi> that is, that it ſhould be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> property of Antichriſt (the more to allure men to receiue his religion) to colour it with as glorious ſhewes of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and Chriſtian religion, as he could deuiſe. By which note by the way wee may ſee, how vaine that their great reaſon is, whereof our late Ieſuites, and Rhemiſtes bragge ſo much, namely, that therefore Popery cannot be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianity, becauſe it cannot be ſhewed (as they ſay) in what Emperours time it beganne, &amp; that it was then eſpied and reſiſted as ſoone as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne. For howſoeuer it be the nature of ſome other hereſies to beginne at once and to ſhewe themſelues bluntly, as bad as they be, at the firſt, yet we ſee it is not ſo with Antichriſtianity, the moſt perilous apoſtaſie, and hotch-potch of all hereſies. And therefore it is no more proofe that popery is not Antichriſtianity, if it could not be told when it firſt came in, and who then by and by with-ſtoode it, than it had beene, that the tares were no tares (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euidently by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paring of them with the wheat they ſhewed themſelues
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:15250:40"/>to be ſo) becauſe that they that then eſpied them could not tel when they were ſowen, and that any reſiſted the ſower thereof, when hee went about to doe it. As then it was ſufficient to conclude them to be tares, becauſe they, compared with the fruite then of the wheate, that was ſowen, were found ſo far to differ from it, as they did: ſo it is a ſufficient argument to vs to proue the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh faith to bee Antichriſtian, in that we haue founde it, as we haue, to differ from Chriſtian doctrine. But to the further proofe thereof (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they bragge they haue faith, &amp; that a true Chriſtian faith, becauſe they with their mouth confeſſe Ieſus Chriſt to be the ſon of the liuing God) they muſt be put in remembrance, that the <hi>Diuels doe as much as that commeth to, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.24</hi> and <hi>Lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> Nay I ſay yet more, that the Diuelles faith is farre better than theirs. For (no doubt of it) they knowe and are fully perſwaded (though they grieue at it) that the merites of Chriſtes owne ſatiefaction performed in his owne perſon by himſelfe are ſo infinitely auailable in the ſight of his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father, that they neede not the addition of any other ſatisfaction or merite to ſaue the beleeuer, and this they will not be brought to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:15250:40"/>confeſſe. Whereupon it muſt needes followe, that they imagine to themſelues ſuch a cruell and mercileſſe God the father, and will not grow to be at one with them for the infinite merites of his owne deare ſonne, without the addition thereunto of their owne: and ſuch a God the ſon they haue framed vnto themſelues, as that either could not, or would not fully in himſelfe and by himſelfe prepare whatſoeuer was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for mans ſaluation. The very conſequent whereof is this, that indeede they neither know God nor beleeue in him, but worſhippe an Idole of their owne heades. For it is moſt true that <hi>S.

Yea euen in the delights here &amp; greateſt ioyes of this world there is ſaciety &amp; weariſomnes: and there is no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor vnchangeablenes in ſtates here, the beſt &amp; moſt floriſhing are ſo ſubiect to mutability and alteration: but in this there is no griefe of mind, nor ſickenes or paine of the body, no <hi>Gangrena, nor any other woe, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.4.</hi> And in the ioies there is continuall comfort, &amp; delight with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out weariſomnes, and that ſuch as is euerlaſting, vnutterable and vnconceiueable by the tongue or heart of man.

For bleſſednes (as you haue hard confirmed vnto you eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of my text it ſelfe) conſiſteth not only in ceaſing from labor woe and paine, but in a poſſeſſion and fruition of a moſt heauenly reward. Nay it is moſt certaine
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:15250:51"/>that if either the body in the meane time vntil the reſurrection were not at reſt and peace, or in the end ſhould not riſe again, the ſoule coulde not bee ſaid to be bleſſed, &amp; to enioy the reward of works done by it in the body. For it were a kinde of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery vnto it to haue the body diſquieted, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be without hope of beeing euer reſtored and ioyned to the body again. Wherfore in that they that dy in the Lord are here pronounced bleſſed, firſt for the bodies of ſuch we learn, that they are in reſt, and (as the ſcripture ſpeaketh) <hi>as it were a ſleepe</hi> in the boſome of their mother the earth, <hi>Acts. <hi>7.1.</hi> Theſſ. <hi>4.15.</hi>

But hee hath (wee ſee) quite paſt that kinde of comforte ouer, and ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth onely of our owne woorkes. Wherefore let vs not (after the manner of the Papiſtes) be ſlack in good works, while we are aliue, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting that by doles.

               </hi> &amp;c. that <hi>the fooliſh virgines that lacked oyle in their lampes of their owne, ſought it at the hands of others, could get none, though they would neuer ſo faine haue had ſome of them, whatſoeuer it had coſt them, and ſo were ſhut out from entring in with the bridegrome into his chamber.</hi> O therefore the ſpiritual craftines of poperye, firſt in deuyſing that there is a thirde place betweene hell and heauen, or a meane place called Purgatory for ſoules departed to go vnto before they goe to heauen: and then in inuen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting ſuch a reliefe for them when they were gone thither by others. For by the firſt they put ſoules departing into ſuch feare, that they cared not what they gaue, &amp; depriued their heires, wiues, and other children of, to buy at their handes their praiers, maſſes, &amp; pardons, wherby they wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to the ſpoile of others inriched themſelues: &amp; by the latter they greatly occaſioned men to be ſlacke in godlines, &amp; looſe in life, whiles health la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſted vpon hope of this prouiſion in the end, &amp; alſo
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:15250:55"/>ſo led them from the preſent faith in Chriſt to a faith in theſe things, and conſequently murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their ſoules, &amp; yet marueilouſly inriched them ſelues. Whereby they haue proued themſelues to be the cruelleſt, cunningeſt, and greateſt theeves, that euer were in the world. They may well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Scriptures, fathers &amp; reaſons for this their deuiſe, thereby to bleare the eies of the ſimple, it is ſo paſſing gainefull vnto them: but in deed and truth the very onely roote and fountaine thereof was inſatiable couecouſnes to inrich themſelues they cared not how, and intollerable ambition to lift vp themſelues into credit among the people, in that thus they made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beleeue it lay in their hands to eaſe them of the paines of Purgatory, &amp; to ſend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to heauen. As for ſcriptures <hi>Roffenſis Perionius, &amp; Soto</hi> are inforced to confeſſe (&amp; yet they were great papiſts) they haue none plain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough to proue it. And how can they, ſeeing Chriſt the father of the ſcriptures hath diuided al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but into two ſorts, <hi>beleeuers in him, and not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers in him, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.18.</hi> and hath told vs there <hi>are two waies only, the one broade leading to hell and the other ſtreite, leading to heauen, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.13.14. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.24.</hi> placing (for further expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his minde concerning the ſtate of thoſe two ſorts of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taking y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one of thoſe two waies) <hi>Lazarus</hi> an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the one ſort <hi>ſtreight in ioy and felicity, and the rich glutton</hi> example of the

Some of them (as <hi>Origen</hi> &amp; his folowers) imagin a purgatory, through which both good &amp; bad ſhal go, &amp; wherin the wicked and the diuell alſo after the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the ende after long tormentes ſhall be ſaued. Which beaſtly hereſie <hi>Aug.</hi> worthily conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth &amp; confuteth in diuerſe places, as they well know. And I am ſure they will not hold ſuch a purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neither. Some other as <hi>Theodor.

Some other among whom <hi>Aug.</hi> is (as they take it) the chiefe man, ſeeme ſomewhat to allow their purgatorie: but indeed the chiefe places which they cite out of him for it, are ſuch, where he ſpeaketh but doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as thus, <hi>For ſitan verum eſt: non eſt incredibile: An ſit quaeripoteſt: <hi>that is, perhaps it is ſo: It is not altogether incredible:</hi>

Faſtoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Ariſtotle,</hi> the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> &amp; ſuch like to fetch their purgatory from, others of any ſound credit they haue none. And as for their reaſons they are but diſcourſes of their own wit, or of others like themſelues laſte before named. And their beſt are, when they are driuen to the vtmoſt, but counterfait writings of fathers fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly bearing their names, and writen by ſome of their owne crew of later time, falſe tales, lying apparitions of men and diuels. For rather than Purgatory ſhalbe left without an author, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell ſhalbe he, and they will make much of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority alſo. For they write <hi>in Lombardica hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoria,</hi> that <hi>Saint Odilio</hi> at <hi>Vulcania</hi> of <hi>Sicilia</hi> hearing that the howlinges and cries of Diuels were hard mourning, that ſoules were take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from them after their departure out of the body by the almes &amp; praiers of their friendes liuing; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the feaſt of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>memoration of the dead for the reliefe of ſoules in purgatory to be ordeined. The truth is, dearly beloued, that their doctrine in this point is ſuch, that if ten thouſand angels
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:15250:57"/>and al the fathers ſhould tel vs that it were true, we ought to bold both them and their aſſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed, it is ſo blaſphemous and iniurious to the precious boud-ſhed of Ieſus Chriſt, the only pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory indeed both of ſoul and body. For to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this they firſt muſt hold that the merites and ſatisfactions of Chriſt are not ſufficient of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and by themſelues (without theſe paines ſuffering in purgatory alſo, and this other relief) to ſaue the ſoule of the beleeuer in him. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they muſt hold, that in the bloud of Chriſt the beleeuer hath forgiuenes of ſinnes, but not of the puniſhment due therefore. Thirdly that God is ſuch a God as will puniſh a ſoule with ſuch hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh torments for the ſame ſinnes, which he hath already forgiuen in his ſonne, <hi>and therfore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to remember no more, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.17.</hi> And laſtly they muſt attribute power to do that to the paines of purgatory, and to this their reliefe, that they talke of, which they hold the bloud of Chriſt hath not done without theſe to ſuch. You ſee ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that theſe fellowes that are ſo buſy in purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory are wel worthy for their labour to finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they depart, but hell and helliſh tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And no doubt of it they ſell heauen ſo faſt to others, that (if they repent not) there wil be no place els left for them but hell. But to leaue them to their fained king the pope and to this his new kingdome, which he hath appropriated to him
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:15250:58"/>and his, it is further to be noted, that in that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> doth not onely ſignifie vp &amp; by, but noteth alſo a continua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of time thenceforth, that to the full comfort of them that die in the Lorde,<note place="margin">The bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſtate of them that dy in the lord is permane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t</note> they may hereby learne, that not onely immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly after their death they ſhal reſt from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and enter vppon their rewarde, and ſo bee bleſſed: but that alſo, this their ſtate is certaine without any falling backe from it: and therefore ſtill their reward is called life euerlaſting in the ſcriptures. And ſurely if this be their ſtate imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly thenceforth without euer any da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling backe to worſe, then of the contrary it muſt needs follow, that quite contrary immediatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their death ſhalbe the ſtate and condition of al that die not in the Lord, and that there is no hope for euer for them to attaine vnto a better. What neede there then a general iudgement, will ſome ſay? I anſwere for two cauſes; that the bodies the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be reſtored to their ſoules againe, that both the ioies of the faithful &amp; paines of the faithles, to the ful manifeſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both of gods mercy &amp; iuſtice, may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſummate and ful: &amp; that ſo god the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may outwardly &amp; ſolemnly iuſtify before al the world his former particular iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which imediatly before at euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s death he had laid vpon them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly we are not to paſſe ouer, or forget how our aduerſaries the Papiſtes abuſe this laſt clauſe of the text. For they hearing that workes
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:15250:58"/>follow ſuch, thereupon inferre, that works merit eternal bliſſe.<note place="margin">The abuſe of this place, therby to prooue that workes merite, confuted.</note> Indeed hereupon it followeth (as I haue noted before) that none haue a right faith in Chriſt, but thoſe that haue alſo good works to accompany them whenſoeuer they dye in the Lord, which I would not haue forgotten: But hereupon to gather that our workes merite hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen we may not. For then they ſhould go before our being in the Lord, &amp; be a cauſe therof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as here it is only ſayde, that they follow and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company ſuch. Which it ſhould ſeeme that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> had obſerued <hi>li. de Fide &amp; operibus ca. <hi>14.</hi>
               </hi> when he ſaid that <hi>good workes goe not before iuſtification, but they follow a man iuſtified,</hi> Let them therefore followe in Gods name, as a fruit of a man in the Lorde, but let them not ſtep before as a cauſe of his being in the fauor of the Lord.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bliſſe: therefore they merite it. Is no man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded but he which hath merited and deſerued it firſt? The heire when he commeth to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers lands is then wel rewarded for his paines he took in his fathers time, &amp; yet hee hath not his inheritance for thoſe his paines, for then rather ſome ſeruant oftentimes ſhould haue the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: but for that he was his fathers ſon &amp; heire before: Euen ſo it is in this caſe, we are born the ſons of God by faith in Chriſt, <hi>Ioh. <hi>1.12.</hi>
               </hi> &amp; <hi>13.</hi> &amp; ſo

               </hi> thereby firſt, and then follow good workes in vs not as a cauſe why we ſhal haue this inheritance, but as a fruit &amp; effect flowing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our thankful mindes to our heauenly father for this notable inheritance thus freely prepared for vs. And yet when we come to the inheritance, becauſe it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth after theſe our works, after a ſort we may ſay, that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there by our paines in working are rewarded, &amp; yet we haue not that reward for our workes, but for that we working ſo, were the ſons &amp; heires of God. But for the better looſing of al ſuch popiſh knots, vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that it is not al one to ſay good works ſhal be rewarded, and to ſay, good works haue merited that rewarde.

               </hi> Againe there is great ods betwixt theſe two queſtions, who ſhal bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and why man ſhalbee ſaued: To the former we anſwere, the well worker: to the latter only for Chriſts ſake apprehended by faith.

No doubt of it, this noble ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whoſe body lieth here amongſt vs to be enco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bed, though euen in outwarde ſhew of almes giuing &amp; other good works he ouermatched moſt merit mongers, yet ſeeing he truſted only to the meries of Chriſt, and neuer to his owne workes, but did them only of loue and thankefulneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>was his God, is among thoſe, of whome it is here ſaid, Their workes accompany them, and therfore now is in ioyful fruition of the reward thereof. Whoſe example as wee that bee of the ſame faith are to followe, that ſo with him we may bee in euerlaſting remembrance both with God, and good men, (as no doubt hee ſhall) ſo it
